  - 1x Fruit
  - 1x Seafood
  - 1x Vegetable
  - 7x Meat

## Healing / Revival

You can heal yourself with Restasigne (green flowers). This heal is for 50% of your max HP before any boosts. Forces and Techters cause a healing Area of Effect when using the item.

You can revive other fallen players with Reversasigne (yellow flowers). This will revive everyone within range of the user and can be done by any class.

  <h3 class="text-center mt-2">Avoid this icon on the map.</h3>
</div>

It indicates a special level 64 boss you cannot deal damage to yet.

**It will not reward you with items nor EXP until you are level 60.**

You have nothing to gain from it. Run away, and it will leave when the storm ends if nobody is fighting it.

## Concerts

When you see this message as a system popup, a concert is about to begin. You can either view it in person in Retem City, or
over the monitor in either Central City or Kvaris Camp.

The concert will begin on the hour after the message is announced, and end about 11 to 12 minutes later.

**If you are anywhere in any city when the concert finishes, you gain a temporary rare drop, meseta earned, and EXP gained bonus for two hours!**

Afterwards, at xx:15, an Urgent Quest will be announced. This Urgent Quest will be accessible at xx:30.

## Personal Shops

## Mission Pass Completion Tips

### There is a ton of time to clear the Mission Pass each season it comes up.

Do not feel pressured to buy tiers. As long as you do your daily missions and weekly missions,
you will tend to clear the majority of it within the first two weeks, finishing it off at the start of the third.

Furthermore, **do not immediately use the 3 Day Shop Pass you get from it the instant you get it.**
Wait until you have a solid three day window you plan on playing a lot and farming stuff worth selling.
_Be responsible!_

## Area Chat Distance

### There is a maximum range your chat will "travel" in town areas.

If you ask a question in town, don't start running around as you may not actually get to see the answer.
