<div class="prose mx-auto">

## if you are having difficulty finding other players in a specific sector, follow these steps:

1. Access a Ryuker Device in the area you wish to find other players in. In this example, we are choosing the Trinitas Ryuker in Central Retem to locate other players in Central Retem

2. From the Ryuker Device's menu, choose "_Room Transfer_"

3. From there, you will be sent to the Room Selection menu. Select "Rooms in Same Sector Only" and set it to "On"

![Room List](/assets/starterguide/room-list.png)

From here, find a room you wish to join and go for it!

Sometimes, however, there may not be a desirable room to join. In that case, just wait a bit and attack stuff.
