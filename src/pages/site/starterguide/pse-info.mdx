## All Areas

- PSE randomly goes up or down by 1 level when defeating enemies. **Clearing a trial while at PSE level 4 triggers a PSE Burst**.

- Defeating enemies within the E marker has no effect on how frequently PSE levels up, but has a very slight and almost unnoticeable effect on how often it goes down.

- The E marker will move when the majority of enemies in the current E marker are defeated. Enemy size and difficulty have no effect on when it moves.

- **Defeating enemies is how you cause Trials to appear.**

- **Thunderstorm, Sandstorm, and Snowstorm weather cause PSE to be locked in at level 4 for their duration.**

- If a PSE Burst has not occured for five minutes for the oldest player in the room, then PSE level can no longer go down. This timer resets upon this player changing.

  - However, if players are constantly leaving and entering the room, the host may change multiple times.

- Passage of otherwise time has no effect on PSE. The level will not change outside of enemies being defeated or a Storm occuring.

- **A PSE Burst will spawn enemies and respawn them immediately upon defeat for a set duration of time.** There is a cap on enemies that can spawn, but it is high.

  - When time runs out, a PSE Burst Climax occurs, spawning either a Silver or Gold boss enemy.

## High Rank Sector Specific

### Rank 3 Aelio, Rank 3 Retem, Rank 2 Kvaris

- A PSE Burst Climax can now also spawn Elite boss enemies as well as Silver and Gold ones.
- **Chaos Trials can raise the PSE level upon clear.** This occurs before the PSE Burst check, so a Chaos Trial can burst from PSE level 3 if you're lucky.

### Rank 3 Retem, Rank 2 Kvaris

- Upon defeating the boss during PSE Burst Climax, there is a roughly 20% chance for a PSE Burst Encore may occur. This causes the PSE Burst to start over.
- **A PSE Burst Climax can only occur once per PSE Burst.**
