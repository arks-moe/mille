## Aelio is straightforward.

Play story missions and move on as soon as you meet the relevant BP scores.

#### You will get a set of 3\* equipment at +29 called the Renaissa Series early on. Equip this as soon as you get it!

- You can equip multiple armors by selecting each armor slot individually in the Equipment menu.
- The weapons can have their potential ability unlocked for free once that side task comes up.

To raise your Battle Power and unlock areas, focus on looking for Cocoons you can clear as well as adding some augments to your gear once you can.

### Gaining EXP

- Most Side Tasks in Aelio aren't worth much EXP yet, but Leah May's side tasks are very good to do daily.

- There is also a weekly mission that scales off your current level to complete them, so that's even more bonus EXP.

- While Aelio Troopers gives a lot of EXP and enhancement materials, it's best not to run it yet as passive leveling speeds up upon reaching Retem.

#### After finishing Aelio's story line, every new character you make will be able to skip Chapter 1 and start from the beginning of Retem's story at level 15.
