Daily missions scale based off your highest level class on your account, and reward more EXP over time.

It is possible to funnel most of the missions to other classes or characters by doing the combat sector dailies, then changing characters.

Afterwards, you can simply clear the "easy" missions of gathering, making food, and feeding a mag to gain the majority of EXP on a lower level character.

### Currently, leveling your subclass does not matter too much.

- Your subclass only provides weapon equipment options, photon arts, and certain class skills depending on class.
- However, your set subclass currently gains 50% of the exp your main class gains, up to level 55.
  - This range is usually "5 levels below level cap", and it will be updated accordingly.
  - Due to this, you can use a high level main class to enter high EXP quests and quickly power through the lower levels of your subclass.

**Popular subclass choices currently include Force to help maintain PP easier while defeating many small enemies over a long time, and Fighter due to increasing damage dealt to stunned enemies.**
